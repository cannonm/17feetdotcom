			<p>Brandon leads the design practice at 17FEET and has been helping clients solve design problems for more than a decade. He believes that the heart of good interaction design is like good story telling and enjoys nothing more than finding that story in every product he works on. Brandon served as the art director of the San Francisco Independent Film Festival from 2004 &ndash; 2005 and his work from that time has been featured in numerous design publications and books. In addition to leading the design team, Brandon also ensures that the office coffee is of the same quality as the work that goes out the door.</p>
