			<h4>Agile. Beautiful.</h4>

			<p>We worked closely with Grockit, the parent company of Learnist, starting when the product was just getting started. Moving fast and working closely with a small development team we created high fidelity, living prototypes. The designs were immediately viewed by a beta testing community, allowing for rapid iteration and improvement.</p>

			<h4>Mobile, Tablet, Web.</h4>

			<p>We embraced a mobile first approach by starting the design process with the mobile app, followed by a tablet app, and ultimately the web. The constraints of this approach provided ample opportunity for simplification along the way.</p>

			<h4>The Future Looks Bright</h4>

			<p>In a matter of months we were able to achieve a very polished experience while adapting to the natural evolution of a new product. Moving forward, we're helping Learnist keep up with rapid growth following a new partnership and funding round with the Discovery Network.</p>
