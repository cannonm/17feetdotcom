			<h4>Quick Iteration</h4>

			<p>To start, we used an iterative process to sketch designs quickly and get them in front of stakeholders and early testers, allowing us to rapidly develop an interaction model that mapped to the user experience and business goals.</p>

		<h4>Interactive Prototypes</h4>

		<p>Once the system was established, we created clickable prototypes preserving the flexibility of&nbsp;sketching while moving into an actionable wireframe&nbsp;system for testing and for development&nbsp;documentation.</p>

		<h4>Rock Star Visuals</h4>
		
		<p>One of the coolest parts of the experience was the instant feedback provided by simply putting a band name in the input field. Just put in your band name and see which songs were performing best, who your top fans are and where they are located. All of this presented in a simple container that makes the band truly look like rockstars with social streams, photos, reviews and popular songs pulled from available sources like Twitter, MySpace, SoundCloud, Last.fm and Facebook.</p>

		<h4>Data &mdash; Hot Rockin&rsquo; Data</h4>
		
		<p>Data is not something that basement-dwelling aspiring rock stars are accustomed to digging into. But at its core, this project is about presenting data. To keep things simple, we developed a fun and uncomplicated data presentation technique. We focused on the big picture items and created a persistent module to emphasize fans, plays and sales with easy access to a deeper dive.</p>

		<h4>Documenting the Design</h4>
		
		<p>As with any startup, getting to a minimum viable product takes a lot of discipline. Working with NXTM product management and technical teams we built a set of requirements and brand style guide to get them to market quickly and give them flexibility to iterate over time.</p>
