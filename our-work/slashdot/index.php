				<h4>Geeking Out</h4>

				<p>When it come to News for Nerds, we're a little bit old school. But that didn't mean we were in love with the look of the 15-year-old site venerable community tech site, Slashdot. To remedy that, we designed a new mobile version of Slashdot transporting them to the mobile age. For us, the key to the project was understanding the audience. Our primary research including face-to-face and phone interviews, surveys, and multiple prototype betas helped guide our design decisions. Working through multiple feedback cycles, we tweaked the experience eventually landing at a final product that's been accepted with a tough audience.</p>

				<blockquote>We've seen a 5x increase in traffic right off the bat and are getting 3x more page views and 3x more time spent after the redesign.</blockquote>

			<h4>Stylin&lsquo; and Profilin&lsquo;</h4>

			<p>Through our research we discovered an opportunity to drive considerable engagement through enhancing the profile experience. We developed a set of achievement-based badges and icons that can be used throughout the site to promote engagement between users and drive more engagement with the site. Plus they look really cool.</p>
