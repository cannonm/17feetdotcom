			<h4>Building a Foundation</h4>

			<p>In addition to its philanthropic mission, the Foundation powers CRM solutions for more than 15,000 nonprofit and higher-ed institutions. In an effort to meet these two goals, this had caused content overload on the site. Our first objective: cut the clutter. We re-organized, prioritized and eliminated content to focus the message and the user experience.</p>

			<h4>Design, Test, Repeat</h4>

			<p>To get the right balance we developed several interactive prototypes that were distributed to key constituents - Foundation stakeholders and key customers. Through an iterative feedback process we landed on a user-flow and presentation layout that got users where they needed to go easily.</p>

			<h4>Visual Design</h4>

			<p>Our goal with the visual design was to allude to the look-and-feel of the Salesforce brand while giving the Foundation a look of itâ€™s own. We introduced hand drawn elements and a more organic color palette to the existing Salesforce brand to achieve a unique look for the Foundation.</p>
